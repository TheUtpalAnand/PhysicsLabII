# Physics Lab Experiments

This repository contains documentation and analysis for my physics lab experiments. Experiments are added and updated as they will be completed.

## Completed Experiments

* **Lee's Method:** Determination of the thermal conductivity of a poor conductor.
   
* **Michelson's Interferometer:** Measurement of the wavelength of a laser and the refractive index of air.

* **Brewster's Angle:** Determination of the refractive index of a material using Brewster's angle.
 
* **Balmer Series and Rydberg Constant:** Measurement of the wavelengths of the Balmer series of hydrogen and determination of the Rydberg constant.

* **Thermistor:** Characterization of a thermistor's temperature dependence.

## Experiments given below are in progress.
  
* **Thermal Expansion:** Measurement of the linear thermal expansion coefficient of a solid.

* **Stefan's Law:** Verification of Stefan's law of radiation.

* **Specific Heat of Solids:** Determination of the specific heat capacity of different solid materials.
    
* **Photoelectric Effect:** Investigation of the photoelectric effect and determination of Planck's constant.
  
* **Millikan's Oil Drop Experiment:** Measurement of the charge of an electron.
 


* This README is a living document and will be updated regularly.
